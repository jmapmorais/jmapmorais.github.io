                    <p>¡VALHALLA out now on bandcamp!</p>
                    <i>13-01-2023</i>
                    <p>VALHALLA was created between autumn 2017 and winter 2018 and is the result of a commission by MJL for an ambient drone piece focused on sleep and sleep time. the four track album is an exploratory dialogue with the immaterial spectres of sleep, personified by the feedback of input-less delay lines, using the hand-manipulation of different parameters of the delays as the conversational medium. check it out on the link below</p>

                <section>
                    <p>João Morais was born in a small fishing village, in the north of Portugal, in 1993.</p>
                    <p>João moved to porto in 2011 where he started his studies on architecture at FAUP. during this period, from 2013 to 2016, he developed design work for the student association, and in 2015 he was one of the founders of Quinzena initiative aiming to question-reform the politics of the educational system. </p>
                    <p>in 2016, together with Francisco Craveiro and Miguel Royo, founded oficina fumo, an experimental multi-disciplinary practice with a focus on socio-political critique. he collaborated with the other founding members on an improv performance (P.S. isla, 2017) and an installation (ctrl-x, 2016), as well as with João Costa and Manuel Carvalho on two critical architecture design projects (2017 and 2018).</p>
                    <p>in 2016 joão began his professional practice as an architectural designer with a collaboration with Telmo Castro Arq., as well as, later that year, a direct commission for a residential conversion project in Billancourt–Rives de Seine, Paris. he worked as a furniture designer in 2018-2019. from 2019 to 2020 he collaborated on the production of several private and corporate events performing functions such as set design, ux design and production management. in 2020 joão started collaborating with Vaga Arquitectura and in 2021 with ATELIERDACOSTA, keeping an external collaborator role on both practices currently.</p>
                    <p>10 years after leaving his introduction to piano and music theory classes, João begins his musical practice in 2012. since then he worked on different projects ranging from a sound fiction in collaboration with Miguel Royo, to a commissioned piece focused on sleep and sleep time (later remixed in the form of the Concrete-Experimental album VALHALLA), as well as soundtracks for Nicole Noia and Marta Miranda.</p>
                    <p>since moving to Porto, João collaborated with individuals such as film-maker and photographer Maria Novo (2017), oboist and musician José Carvalho (2019 - ongoing), as well as with the inventor-architects Beatriz Merouço and João Costa (2018 - ongoing).</p>
